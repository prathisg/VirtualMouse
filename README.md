# üñ±Ô∏è AI Virtual Mouse using OpenCV and MediaPipe

This project implements a gesture-controlled virtual mouse using your webcam. By tracking your hand in real-time, the system allows you to move the cursor and perform mouse clicks **without touching the mouse**, using only your fingers.

It uses **OpenCV** for video processing, **MediaPipe** for hand tracking, and **Autopy** (or PyAutoGUI) for system mouse control.

##  Features

- Ô∏è**Real-time** hand detection using MediaPipe
- **Cursor control:** Move the mouse pointer using the **tip of your index finger**.
- **Mouse Click:** Simulate a **mouse click** by bringing the **index and middle fingers close together**.
- **Smooth Movement:** Cursor movement is smoothed using interpolation for better control.
-Ô∏è **Touchless Interaction:** No physical mouse required ‚Äî just a webcam and your hand.
